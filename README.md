A GUI that drives the Gradle tooling API. Intended to be used to test the tooling API rather than as a Gradle build
runner, but it certainly could function as such.

Requires Java 8 or later. To use:

    ./gradlew run

Or

    ./gradlew installApp
    ./build/install/tooling-api-ui/bin/tooling-api-ui
